Suggest that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but instead, both should depend on abstractions.
In the context of Django REST Framework (DRF), this means that you should rely on abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations.

class BlogPostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    author = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
    
    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = '__all__'
        
    def get_author(self, obj):
        return {
            'id': obj.author.id,
            'username': obj.author.username,
            'email': obj.author.email,
        }
