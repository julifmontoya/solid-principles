Each class should only have one specific purpose or responsibility.
In the context of Django REST Framework (DRF) a view should only handle one resource.
For example, if you have a blog application, you should have separate views for creating a blog post and updating a blog post. This view is responsible for creating a new blog post. It doesnâ€™t handle any other actions, such as updating or deleting blog posts.

class BlogPostCreateAPIView(CreateAPIView):
    queryset = BlogPost.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BlogPostSerializer
